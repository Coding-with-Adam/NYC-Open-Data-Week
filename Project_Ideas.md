Feel free to update, modify, and add ideas as you see fit. Once you decide on a project idea you would like to work on, please let the group know. Maybe others will want to work on the same idea with you. Possible 
project presentation is in March 2025.

## Data Visualization:
- [ ] Create a dashboard that explores water usage:

- [ ] NYC Housing Profiler dashboard:
  - [ ] Report Card for housing only. Multisection dashboard to compare emissions, water usage, green power, Energy star Score. Normalized Metrics Needed. User can compare his community board with others within same Borough. User can search by property and get comparsion with buildings of the same community board. Maps, cards with KPI and charts to support the analysis. This helps to assess  Overall Community Properties and single properties status.

- [ ] Cluster "green" buildings by location, property type, size, etc. Allow users to find correlations between energy scores and other variables. Help people understand what they need to do to make the building greener.
-	[ ] Compare my building with a benchmark
-	[ ] The user feeds in a utility bill and we normalize it against buildings that operate under similar weather.

## LLMs / AI:
-	[ ] NYC passed legislation in 2020 with implementation targets. We can try to work with thatâ€¦ LLM gets access to the legislation (RAG) and then the LLM identifies what building are closest to their target
and which ones are lagging. (John I hope I got this idea right. Feel free to expand or modify). 
- [ ] Use an LLM to perform a building analysis. The user gives the building address and the LLM provides a thorough analysis and summary of the building and how it compares to others. Give tooling to LLM to create graphs.
Maybe we generate a similar report to the one I get monthly from the NYC electrical company (ConEd):

- [ ] Use an LLM to help user to understand the data dictionary (embeddings + QA chat)
- [ ] Build a RAG database that the team can use for any model they choose. Malini
